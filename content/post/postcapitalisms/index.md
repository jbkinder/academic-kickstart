McKenzie Wark’s *Capital is Dead: Is This Something Worse?* (2019) is built on a controversial wager in many Marxist circles. The wager is that capitalism, regardless of adjectives, is no longer the dominant mode of production. We’ve transitioned from capitalism to, well, “something worse,” as the subtitle's open provocation suggests. This political economic arrangement gathered under the signifier of “something worse” emerges from the reality that the dominant class is no longer that class that owns material means of production, but rather, information. In this formulation, capital becomes vectors, capitalists become vectoralists, and proletarians become hackers. This is not to say that Wark claims capitalism no longer exists, but rather that, following Marx’s own recognition that numerous modes of production exists in consecutive tension with and alongside dominant ones in a given historical moment, it has been displaced with a previously emergent  mode of production.
